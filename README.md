# Note:
I apologize for not having enough commits - I really struggled to figure out how to connect GitHub with my Jupyter notebooks. I downloaded the starter files and saved them locally while I worked on them. I tried to clone my GitHub repo earlier in the day, but I kept receiving a fatal error and not being able to connect to GitHub. I did the same cloning process 20 minutes ago and it worked, so I just dragged and dropped my files to copy over. Again, I will hopefully be able to get all of the commits next time!

# Analysis of PyCity

This is demonstrated in the last summary tables as well as the Top/Bottom Performance dataframes. The top 5 best performing schools were Charter schools, and the bottom 5 were District schools.
